# Scan Functions in Maxima
A function to scan the dependencies between functions in a Maxima session.

When a package is scanned some things can be eventually improved:
  Some functions can be used anonymously (lambda functions).
  Some functions can be handle as a single function that allows additional arguments.

Comments are welcome about which properties of a package graph are desirable.
